Created react + typescript app in this dd_takehome_react folder using this command
`npx create-react-app dd_takehome_react --template typescript`

Installed `antd` package

Installed `@types/react` package

Installed `babel-plugin-import`

Installed `babel-plugin-transform-class-properties`

Changed CSS files to less files and then `npm install less less-loader`

Installed `webpack webpack-cli` - didn't work. needed more loaders. So I removed webpack completely

then `npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader`

Installed css-modules-typescript-loader - didn't work
Tried this instead `npm install -D typescript-plugin-css-modules` - did not solve the issue

Finally I used this to solve the css issue - https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/06/22/css-module-typescript/
